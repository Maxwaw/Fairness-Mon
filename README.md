# Fairness-Monitor

In this project we have surveyed parts of what makes an machine learning model fair.
We have worked on the 'Improved Adult Dataset' and wanted to study especially the influence of context (spatial and temporal) on fairness.

This project started as part of a FU Berlin Softwareproject in the summer semester 2022.

This Repository contains the finished and refined parts of our project.
However we also have a google folder, where older stuff etc. can be found.
